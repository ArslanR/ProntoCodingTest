# ProntoCodingTest
This file includes Java code that is written for the coding test task for the Pronto Woven Graduate Program.

The assumptions carried out while coding are as follows:

1. The robot faces the NORTH direction as the initial direction.
2. Directions NORTH, EAST, SOUTH and WEST are represented with 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
3. The input is validated before proceeding with the result so any wrong input gives an error accordingly.
4. P1 and p2 corresponds to X and Y coordinates.
