# ProntoCodingTest
This file includes Java code that is written for the coding test task for the Pronto Woven Graduate Program.

This code has been tested on the compiler "BlueJ".

The assumptions carried out while coding are as follows:

1. The robot faces the NORTH (0) direction as the initial direction.
2. Initial position is at the coordinates (0,0).
3. P1 and p2 corresponds to X and Y coordinates.
4. Directions NORTH, EAST, SOUTH and WEST are represented with 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
5. The input is validated before proceeding with the result so any wrong input gives an error accordingly.
